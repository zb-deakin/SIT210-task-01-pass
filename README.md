# SIT210 - Task 1 pass

## Functionality

1. When a button is pressed on the breadboard, an LED will flash my name in Morse Code
2. If the button is pressed again (while name is being flashed in Morse Code), the sequence will be reset and start blinking my name from the first letter again

#### Notes
To indicate that a new letter is starting, there will be a slightly longer pause and the internal LED will light up during that pause as a visual indicator.
